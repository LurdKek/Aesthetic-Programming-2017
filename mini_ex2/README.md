<h5> Describe my coding process </h5>
My coding process consisted primarily of an iterative process. I would program one part of the code, for example the textbox, and then I would run the code and appraise the results. If something seemed off or out of place I would remove it, and if something felt right I would add it to the code. At times, I would let some of the other people from my study group judge the program and listen to their inputs, if they had any.

<h5> What constitutes a program </h5>
I would say a program consists mainly of two parts. The “pre-program” part, which is everything you define for the program to draw upon. This could be variables, background, canvas size. The second part is the program while it runs. Here it runs in loops, checking if some of the predefined variables change, and if they do, the software will decide what changes to make to the program.

<h5> Reflect on the notion of error (what is error to you?) </h5>
To me, error is something unexpected. This constitutes both what is unexpected for the programmer, the user, and the program itself. If a user expects one outcome from a program, but something unexpected happens, then it could be considered as an error.
