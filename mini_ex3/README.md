<h1> mini_ex3 - Design your own throbber </h1>

<h5>Describe a bit about your throbber design (your concept and execution)?</h5>
My throbber was inspired by the throbber design used in the video game Portal by Valve. 
I liked the idea of the shapes being triangles, and I spent a lot of time messing around with the coordinates, to get it to look right. 
The throbber is supposed to look like the aperture of a camera. 
I wanted to make that more obvious, so I added the text segment afterwards. 
At first, I didn’t really wanted to overdo the throbber too much, however, I ended up adding a lot of accessories 
to the final product (text, music and so on).

<h5>How may we use programming to reflect and inquire digital (visual) culture?</h5>
I feel like graphical illustrations of programs help humans understand the processes behind a program. 
They act like a translator for the computational processes. However, they can also make the software more obvious to the user. 
When your’ watching a series on Netflix or a video on YouTube, and the clip suddenly starts to buffering, 
then you can completely lose your immersion. You become aware of the fact that you’re being entertained through a program.
